# Title: v0.0.2-1-3-1 - Cancel Edit Mode

## Summary: 
This task involves implementing the client-side functionality to cancel the "edit mode" on the user profile page. When a user clicks the "Cancel" button, the page should revert to "view mode," and any changes made to the input fields should be discarded.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Given the user is in "edit mode" on their profile page, when they click the "Cancel" button, the page should return to "view mode."
- Any changes made to the input fields should be discarded, and the fields should display the original, unmodified data.
- No API call should be made.

### Test Strategy:
- **Unit Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library to test the `Profile.jsx` component.
  - Verify that the component's state correctly transitions from `isEditing = true` to `isEditing = false` on button click.
  - Assert that the input fields are no longer visible and the original data is displayed.
  - Confirm that no API calls are made when the "Cancel" button is clicked.
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Log in and navigate to the profile page.
  - Click the "Edit" button and make changes to the input fields.
  - Click the "Cancel" button and verify that the UI reverts to its original state and the changes are not saved.

## 📝 Code Changes

**Description:**
A new `handleCancel` function will be added to the `Profile.jsx` component to handle the cancellation of the edit mode. This function will reset the form data to its original state and toggle the `isEditing` state back to `false`.

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`
```diff
- // Save and Cancel handlers will be implemented in subsequent tasks.
+ const handleCancel = () => {
+     setFormData({
+         email: user.email,
+         skills: user.skills || '',
+         hourly_rate: user.hourly_rate || 0,
+     });
+     setIsEditing(false);
+ };
```
