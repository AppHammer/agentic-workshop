# The Tasker Marketplace Platform

## About

The Tasker Platform is a marketplace to connect local workers (taskers) with the people who need the work done (customers). For example if you need help moving furniture, trimming bushes, cleaning your house, or assembling IKEA furniture, you can hire a tasker to help you with that! 

**Taskers** are the task seekers. They can sign up to the platform to find work in their local area and earn money by completing tasks for customers. Specific actions of a tasker:

- They can create a profile, listing their skills and services, and set their own rates.
- Bid on tasks posted by customers.
- Accept offers made to them.

**Customers** hire the taskers. They can sign up to the platform to find local help for various tasks. 
Specific actions of a customer:

- Post tasks they need help with, including details like location, date, time, and budget, and nature of work.
- Make offers to taskers that have bid on their tasks.

**Agreement** is reached when a customer accepts a tasker's bid or when a tasker accepts an offer made by a customer. Once an agreement is in place, the tasker completes the work and the customer pays for the service through the platform.

The platform handles all payments and provides a secure messaging system to facilitate communication between customers and taskers.

Completed tasks can be rated and reviewed by both parties to build trust and reputation within the community.

Completed tasks are archived for future reference.

## Technology stack

At this stage the goal for tasker is a minimum viable product (MVP).

Build the tasker platform as a single-page application (SPA) using the following technologies:

- Python with FastAPI for the backend API
- React for the frontend user interface
- SQLite for the database
