# Lesson 4: Memory

Bigger tasks, bigger codebases. 

## What are we building?

Adding Memory to our flow


## Steps A - Using a simple memory-bank

1. Lets add a simple memory bank to our agents
    - Influenced by https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/tree/main
    - We use a customized version of this
    - The Architect Mode, Orchestrator get it
2. Switch to arhitect mode and init memory bank
    - init memory bank
3. Now the orchestrator mode, product manager mode and arhitect mode will update the memory bank when needed.
4. Lets fix the bug using the team, and you should see the memory bank get updated by the orchestrator


## Steps B - Whats Next?
1. More advanced memory stategies
    - Cipher
    - review @docs/v0.0.2/implementation/v0.0.2-qa-summary.md and update cipher

2. Code Indexing...



## Takeaways:

- Memory allow agents to communicate progress and store relevant information and decisions.
