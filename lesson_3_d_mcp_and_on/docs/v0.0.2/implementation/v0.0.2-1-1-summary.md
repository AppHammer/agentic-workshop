# Implementation Summary: Issue v0.0.2-1-1 - Enable Edit Mode

## Issue Information
- **Issue ID:** v0.0.2-1-1
- **Title:** Enable Edit Mode
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Implementation Date:** 2025-11-11

## Requirements Summary
Implement client-side functionality to enable an "edit mode" on the user profile page. When a user clicks the "Edit" button, the static profile fields transform into editable input fields, and the action buttons change to "Save" and "Cancel."

## Implementation Overview

### Architect Phase - Requirements Analysis
The Architect analyzed the issue and created comprehensive specifications including:
- Clear summary of requirements
- Architectural considerations (React frontend with Vite, component-level state management)
- Technical specifications (state management with `isEditing` and `formData`)
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Expected file changes

### Development Phase - Code Implementation
The Developer successfully implemented:

**Files Modified:**
- [`frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`](frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx:1) - Added edit mode state management and conditional rendering

**Files Created:**
- [`frontend/package.json`](frontend/package.json:1) - Added testing dependencies
- [`frontend/vitest.config.js`](frontend/vitest.config.js:1) - Vitest configuration
- [`frontend/src/setupTests.js`](frontend/src/setupTests.js:1) - Test setup file
- [`frontend/src/pages/Profile.test.jsx`](frontend/src/pages/Profile.test.jsx:1) - Comprehensive test suite with 11 tests

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `isEditing` state variable to manage edit mode
- Added `formData` state to hold form values (email, skills, hourly_rate)
- Implemented `handleEdit()` function to enable edit mode
- Implemented conditional rendering to switch between view and edit modes
- Input fields properly populated with user data from profile
- Edit button replaced with Save/Cancel buttons in edit mode

**Testing:**
- 11 comprehensive unit tests created
- All tests passing (11/11)
- Tests cover: initial render, edit mode toggle, input fields, button states, acceptance criteria, edge cases

### QA Phase - Validation
The QA Engineer validated the implementation with **PASS** status:

**Code Quality Review:**
- ✅ Code quality and maintainability verified
- ✅ React best practices followed
- ✅ No security concerns
- ✅ Adherence to project coding standards

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 11 unit tests passing
- ✅ Edit button functionality verified
- ✅ Input field transformation verified
- ✅ Form data pre-population verified
- ✅ Button state changes verified
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
- ✅ Static text replaced by input fields when Edit clicked
- ✅ Input fields pre-populated with user's current data
- ✅ Edit button replaced by Save and Cancel buttons

**Recommendation:** Approved for merge

## Deployment Notes
- No backend changes required
- No database migrations needed
- Fully backward compatible
- Save and Cancel functionality intentionally not implemented (future tasks)

## Next Steps
The following related issues will build upon this implementation:
- v0.0.2-1-2: Update Profile Data (Save functionality)
- v0.0.2-1-3: Cancel Edit Mode (Cancel functionality)

## Testing Instructions
