# Test Documentation: v0.0.2-2-2-1 - Add Tasker Professional Details to Profile View

## Feature Summary

- [x] Empty professional fields display "Not provided" placeholder text
- [x] Professional section visually separated from Account Information section
- [x] Zero hourly rate displays as "Not provided" (not "$0.00")
- [x] Component handles null, undefined, and empty string values gracefully
- [x] Customer users do not see Professional Information section
